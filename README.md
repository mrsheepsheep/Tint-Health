# Tint Health
Tint Health is a small and lightweight Bukkit / Spigot plugin.
It uses the Minecraft Vanilla Worldborder warning effect to create a blood effect around the screen depending how much health / damage you get.
_Your game graphic settings must be set to Fancy in order to see the effect._

# Install
Like all other plugins, put TintHealth.jar in your plugin folder and you're done !
You can then take a look at the configuration file.

# How to use
Blood effect will appear every time your health is changed.
A fade mode can be enabled in the configuration to fade the effect out of the screen over time.

Please read the [Wiki](https://github.com/mrsheepsheep/Tint-Health/wiki) for a simple explaination of the config and modes.
